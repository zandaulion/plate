# Bitey — Google Play identity

- Play title: **Bitey — Private Food Log**
- Tagline: **Nutrition, privately.**
- Android package and namespace: `com.zandaulion.bitey`
- Launcher label: **Bitey**
- First release version: **1.0.0** (`versionCode` 1)
- Intended upload artifact: `bitey-private-food-log-1.0.0.aab`

The package name is permanent after the first Play upload. It is deliberately
separate from the pre-release `app.plate` package, so testing installations do
not accidentally become the store identity.

## Before the first upload

1. Create the Bitey app in Play Console with the title and tagline above.
2. Enrol it in Play App Signing and create an upload key kept outside Git.
3. Build a signed release AAB with version code 1.
4. Complete the store listing, privacy policy, Data safety form, content rating,
   camera permission declaration, and testing track requirements.
